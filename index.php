    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
    EcoBasket is a web-based platform designed to help markets sell products that are close to their expiration date instead of throwing 
    them away. We believe small changes like this can make a big difference for both businesses and the environment.</p>

    <h3>Our Goal</h3>
    <p>
    Our aim is to reduce unnecessary product waste by creating a system where markets can offer short-dated products at lower prices. 
    This benefits consumers with better deals, helps markets avoid losses, and supports a more sustainable way of shopping.</p>
